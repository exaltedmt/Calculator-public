# GUI Mockup

The project asks for a basic calculator, but must also involve important operational checks
of a calculator. Many of the elements of this calculator are interactive (ie. binary numbers, and
toggleable math types). The theme of theme of the calculator is that of an ios device, controlled by 
the CSS file.

## Main GUI

Smooth, sleeck gradient design.

## Additional Interface Elements

-Each label has an mouse action.
